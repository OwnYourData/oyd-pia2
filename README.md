## Your Data Vault    
Usually you have to pass on your data to the operators of web services and apps in order to be able to use them. OwnYourData, however, turns the tables: You keep all your data and you keep them in your own data vault. You bring apps (data collection, algorithms and visualization) to you in the data vault.
